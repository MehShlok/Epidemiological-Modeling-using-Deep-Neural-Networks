**Epidemiological Deep Neural Networks:**

This is the official project worth 1 credit presented in the course Mathematical Modeling, at BITS Goa lectured by Dr. Anushaya Mohapatra. A supplement for the advanced knowledge of Epidemiological Compartmental Modeling was acquired through the Lecture Series by Dr. Abhishek Pandey, Yale University as a part of The SPARC Project, conducted in person at BITS Goa.

Epi-DNNs (Epidemiological Deep Neural Networks) is a novel idea proposed by (Xiao Ning, Linlin Jia, Yongyue Wei, Xi-An Li, Feng Chen) in the paper (Epi-DNNs: Epidemiological priors informed deep neural networks for modeling COVID-19 dynamics) published in 2023 in the prestigious journal of (Computers in Biology and Medicine). The research paper is made available in this repository or plz visit [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482523001580).  

I have improvised as following:
The algorithm is implemented on a variation of SEIRD Model and models the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic in India. Here the Susceptible Population is considered to be the Total Indian Population at the time of Covid - 19, Birth Rate and Natural Death Rate is neglected (as it will make the model much more complex). E,I,R,D are Exposed , Infected , Recovered and Death due to infection respectively. The dataset used is Collected by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Organised by PRS legislative research(present in the Github Repository) or [here](https://prsindia.org/covid-19/overview) / Kaggle.
(All the images are results obtained from the given code and dataset, figures can be easily cross-checked).

Further Improvements: The realisation that this concept can be applied to almost all Epidemiological Compartment Models to make them much more efficient and to model any virus,disease,pandemics,epidemics.
Moreover this can be used to forecast future infectious diseases and their growth, precautions to be taken, various interventions that can be applied, etc.
