**Epidemiological Deep Neural Networks:**

This is the official project worth 1 credit presented in the course Mathematical Modeling, at BITS Goa lectured by Dr. Anushaya Mohapatra. A supplement for the advanced knowledge of Epidemiological Compartmental Modeling was acquired through the Lecture Series by Dr. Abhishek Pandey, Yale University as a part of The SPARC Project.

The novel concept used in this project is motivated by the paper attached, by Feng Chen on Epi-DNNs: Epidemiological priors informed deep neural networks for modeling Covid-19 Dynamics. The algorithm is implemented on a SEIRD Model and model the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in India. 

Epi-DNNs (Epidemiological Deep Neural Networks) is a novel idea proposed by (Xiao Ning, Linlin Jia, Yongyue Wei, Xi-An Li, Feng Chen) in the paper (Epi-DNNs: Epidemiological priors informed deep neural networks for modeling COVID-19 dynamics) published in 2023 in the prestigious journal of (Computers in Biology and Medicine). 

The dataset used is Collected by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Organised by PRS legislative research(present in the Github Repository).
